# A few words about this fork

This fork was created to add some stuff that I was sorely missing from the original excellent work the ReactFlux dev have done, such as:

- Resizable panes
- Mark as read functionality based on days

- AI Summarization of articles
- New Content section contains old feed + article three dot menu options, plus new colour and global font setting for the whole app.

- Some theme changes I was applying with Tampermonkey up until now.

- Some other stuff as well (Greek localization support, clicking on feeds/categories always refreshes the feed, etc.)

This fork is not thoroughly tested (even though I use it every day) and I bet some stuff are broken because of these additions. Using LLMs just for fun to make these additions probably didn't help either. So, the usual; use at your own peril etc.

What follows is the original README contents from electh/ReactFlux:main.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have a working Miniflux instance
2. Directly use our [online demo instance](https://reactflux.pages.dev) or deploy ReactFlux using one of the methods below
3. Log in using your Miniflux username and password or API key (recommended)

### Update Notification Source (Self-hosting/Forks)

The "update available" icon compares your current build metadata with a remote `version-info.json`.

By default it checks:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kombatant/ReactFlux/main/src/version-info.json`

If you use a fork, another branch, or your own release pipeline, set:

`VITE_VERSION_INFO_URL=https://your-source/version-info.json`

Then rebuild so the setting is embedded in the app.

For troubleshooting, you can also enable:

`VITE_VERSION_CHECK_DEBUG=true`

This prints version-check decisions and compared metadata in the browser console.

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages

ReactFlux is built with React and generates a set of static web files after building, which can be directly deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

You can deploy it on Cloudflare Pages by selecting `Framework preset` as `Create React App`.

### Using Pre-built Files

You can download the pre-built files from the `gh-pages` branch and deploy them to any static hosting service that supports single-page applications (SPA).

Make sure to configure URL rewriting to redirect all requests to `index.html`.

If you are deploying using Nginx, you might need to add the following configuration:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

Or using Caddy, you might need to add the following configuration:

```caddyfile
try_files {path} {path}/ /index.html
```
